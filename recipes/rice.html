        <h3>Description</h1>
        <p> This savory Indian rice recipe is flavored with whole spices and fried onions. Soaking the basmati rice before cooking makes all the difference. Serve this Indian-style rice with your favorite Indian curry or dal (lentils). Make sure you warn people not to bite into the whole spices! </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups basmati rice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 pods green cardamom</li>
            <li>2 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cumin seed</li>
            <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place rice into a bowl with enough water to cover. Set aside to soak for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in the last 10 minutes of soaking, heat oil in a large pot or saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves, then stir in cumin seed. Cook and stir until fragrant and toasted, about a minute, then add onion to the pot. Saute onion until the color is a rich golden brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain water from rice, and stir into the pot. Cook and stir rice until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Add water and salt, and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Let stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork before serving.</li>
        </ol>
