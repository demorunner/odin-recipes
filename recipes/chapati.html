        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup hot water or as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flours and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and olive oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin, like a tortilla.</li>
            <li>When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</li>
        </ol>
